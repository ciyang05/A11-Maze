Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Kiara Sunil Singh - I enjoyed this assignment because I liked applying graph theory to a real life game! I found that this assignment made graph properties more understandable because I got a hands on perspective about how they work and what you can do with them. Initially, I found it difficult to understand how a graph works and how to use them in an effectdive way, but eventually I learned more about how to traverse through a graph and keep track of where the user is currently at.
